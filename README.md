# Neural Network Architecture Comparison for Pong AI

## Overview
This project compares three neural network architectures (SimpleFF, DeepFF, and LSTM) for controlling a paddle in the classic game of Pong, evaluating their performance through direct competition.

## Project Objectives
1. Select a real-world control task (Pong in this case)
2. Apply three neural network architectures and evaluate their performance
3. Interpret results and determine the best-performing model with reasoning
4. Document findings in a well-structured project report

## Setup & Execution
